This bot solves the game Glimmer and Gloom from Flight Rising a desired amount of times. The delays between steps, the amount of games played/finished, and more variables can all be customized.

The bot relies on visual reading of on-screen pixels: the pixel position of the top left hex, distance to the hex to the right of it must be tuned before using the bot. (if you want to repeat games you should also tune the "play game", "hard mode", and "play again" button positions.
